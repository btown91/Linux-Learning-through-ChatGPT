I am new to learning Linux and so the way I am working on learning is by using ChatGPT.
My goal with this is to show progression in my linux skills and post what i have learned.
I am also working on a cybersecurity degree through SANS and I have a goal to get into the industry.

This repoisitory is to show progress in my skills and that I am committed to improving myself and on constant journey to learn.
